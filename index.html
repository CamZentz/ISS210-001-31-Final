                <!-- About Section Content-->
                <div class="container"><p>Pursuing a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) major or field brings in many benefits, including a larger scope of opportunities, a higher salary, a dedicated commitment to improve the lives of communities through creative and functional methods, and helps a student and professional develop and demonstrate effective critical thinking skills. Institutions, including The Tomás Rivera Policy Institute, recognize the United States as one of the best locations for STEM opportunities and careers. Yet, the Tomás Rivera Policy Institute interestingly highlights that the U.S. does not have enough STEM professionals to contribute to the economy. There are numerous reasons to justify this trend. Some reasons include equality of opportunities in STEM fields for students and professionals belonging to historically underrepresented communities. These include African American students and Hispanic American students, who frequently face additional barriers when considering a STEM field, such as financial factors, cultural and social factors, and the quality of education and training available to them. Additionally, international students and immigrants in the United States comprise a good amount of STEM students and professionals. Although international STEM students are eligible to redeem the benefit of working up to three years on Optional Practical Training post-graduation, immigration law makes it challenging for their employers to retain them in the longer run due to the limit on the number of H1-B visas available and longer processing time, further increasing the shortage of STEM professionals in the country. This website will present the factors and challenges students from underrepresented communities face when pursuing STEM fields and spread awareness about the urgent need to examine and explore ways to alleviate the shortage of STEM professionals in the United States.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Hispanic STEM students face challenges related to student behavior characteristics. They often don’t have enough exposure to the skills they need for their fields. According to The Tomás Rivera Policy Institute, secondary school preparation directly impacts postsecondary science and engineering persistence and completion. It is seen that students don’t always receive that quality preparation and education, thereby limiting their continued success and completion. Moreover, that leads to having a negative impact on their self-confidence, as The Tomás Rivera Policy Institute also suggests that Hispanic students feel disadvantaged if they studied in schools that didn’t have an excellent academic reputation. Secondly, Hispanic students are often faced with limited access to resources that can support them as they work towards achieving their academic and professional goals. The Tomás Rivera Policy Institute highlights the importance and need for schools to have a curriculum that enforces equity of student learning, including in math and science. Secondly, there is equally a shortage of STEM trained teachers and usually teachers teaching STEM subjects, who are not well trained, are whom Hispanic students and other students belonging to underrepresented groups learn from. To that effect, it aggravates the fading likelihood to find and retain STEM students and professionals. Moreover, the family characteristics of a Hispanic family have an impact on the decision and continued success of a Hispanic STEM professional. Many Hispanic students are first-generation college students, that adds onto the challenge of navigating college life and academic pressure. With that, their parents aren’t always able to support them academically. That has a significant impact on a student’s continued success, especially when STEM subjects require parental support. Furthermore, Hispanic families culturally prefer to live together and nearby. That contributes to a student deciding to study at a community college, that may not have STEM fields, instead to moving to another part of the country or another city to pursue a STEM degree.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Throughout the years there has been one constant when it comes to the STEM field. It is the fact that there is a high majority of white males in this field. Also, when it comes to college and predominantly white schools. There is a big underrepresentation when it comes to minorities. In the article “Fostering STEM Persistence for Underrepresented Minority Students Attending Predominantly White Institutions” it states that only 14.7% of all STEM bachelorette degrees given out each year are from black, lantix, or native american students. When it comes to these predominantly white schools it makes it much more difficult for these students to succeed compared to other schools where minority students make up more of the student body. Because of this most students feel like they have to try and earn the right to be at these schools. Due to this they lose interest in pursuing their goals in STEM. However, faculty can give a great amount of help by constantly enforcing the idea that the students can succeed and that they don’t need to “prove” themselves in order to go to the school. In the TED Talk “The Future of STEM Depends on Diversity” with Nicole Cabrera Salazar she gives many good points on why this is a problem. She asks the audience to “think of any famous scientist.” She then goes on to explain that most of the audience probably thought of a white man. After explaining this she asks the same question again. This time however, she explains how everyone tried this time to think of a female scientist, but that most of them thought of a white female scientist. This furthermore explains our topic that minorities are underrepresented in today's society.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>As stated in our about section; many students that are in underrepresented groups experience unfair treatment and microaggressions, especially in STEM. Many underrepresented groups are treated differently every day. For example, racism towards people of color, ableism towards people with disabilities, sexism against women, etc. All of these marginalized groups experience unfairness every day (some more than others); especially in fields overrun by cishet, white males. One of those fields includes STEM. When asking people who they imagine in STEM related fields, typically the first people to come to mind are white men. When comparing women and men with achieving bachelor degrees, 57% of all bachelor degrees are achieved by women, so why are women so underrepresented in STEM fields? There is an old riddle that is a great example of women being underrepresented in STEM; “A boy and his father both hurt themselves playing catch so they went to the hospital. The doctor who was set to operate on the son said; ‘I cannot operate on this boy, he is my son’, how can that be?” This riddle has always confused people; how can the boy be the doctor's son when the father is there for help, too? The answer… the doctor is the boy’s mother. It is not outlandish for a doctor to be a girl, however we still assume a doctor to be a male. As you can see in this table, men typically tend to study STEM related fields more often than women. However, this is not due to lack of interest. Many researchers believe that the sexism and gender differences in the world have a big effect on many women’s choice to pursue STEM. A study done by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the stereotype bias begins in school. Cvencek, Meltzoff, and Greenwald found that by 2nd grade girls and boys had already developed subject stereotypes. Boys associated themselves with math and girls associated themselves with reading. Women have also been found to leave STEM at higher rates than men. When looking at different research, a lot of this is believed to be to underrepresentation and lack of self-confidence. When asked their own opinions of their STEM related abilities, women rated themselves lower than men, regardless of academic grades/evidence. Finally, a personal anecdote; I am a physics major. My first semester I had a chemistry lab and the last day, my group was talking about our majors. When I said that I was a physics major, the man in my group was very surprised and asked me a bunch of questions. Some of that surprise could be due to it being an 8:00am class and some things I said were not the smartest things because I was tired. However, every time I tell a man I am a physics major I get surprised reactions. However, when I tell women, they are not surprised. Which I think is a great example of the underrepresentation of women in STEM. Overall, the sexism and stereotypes girls are exposed to at young ages, along with the underappreciation for women in STEM; are all things that need to be resolved. So women can get the recognition and representation they deserve in these fields.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The underrepresentation of Native Americans in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers has been a persistent issue, and this article explores a possible factor that contributes to it. The study looks at communal goal incongruence, which is the mismatch between students’ emphasis on communal work goals and the non communal culture of STEM. The authors surveyed Native American and White American students in STEM and non-STEM majors to examine the prominence of communal goals and how they affect students’ feelings of belonging, motivation, persistence, and perceived performance in STEM. According to the article, Native American students bring a distinctive viewpoint and orientation to STEM that could not mesh with the field's current culture. Instead of just having a general desire to "help others," those with a communal goal orientation are dedicated to supporting their tribal communities. This dedication might be a useful tool for promoting inclusivity and diversity in STEM professions. The report also emphasizes the need for interventions and institutional reforms to help Native American students stay in STEM fields, such as initiatives that promote a feeling of community, mentorship, and career development opportunities that are in line with shared objectives. Overall, the study sheds light on an important issue of underrepresentation in STEM and highlights the need to consider cultural differences and the importance of community values in creating inclusive STEM environments. By recognizing and addressing communal goal incongruence, institutions can better support Native American students and promote greater diversity and inclusivity in STEM fields.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The article "SHUT OUT: WHY BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS ARE UNDER-ENROLLED IN AP STEM COURSES" sheds light on the challenges that Black and Latino students face when pursuing STEM fields. As the authors of the report note, "2 in 5 Black and Latino students say they really enjoy STEM courses and aspire to go to college, but less that 3 percent are enrolling in STEM courses." These students express a desire to make a difference, to discover something new, and to help their communities, but they often have limited access to Advanced Placement (AP) STEM courses, which can help prepare them for college and careers in these fields. The report identifies several systemic causes for under-enrollment, including "reliance of education leaders on a student’s persistence or assumptions about their intelligence instead of addressing barriers that make it difficult for students to enroll" and "reliance on single denominators of readiness, such as GPA and test scores." The authors argue that these challenges faced by Black and Latino students belonging to historically underrepresented communities make it more difficult for them to pursue STEM fields, limiting their opportunities for future success. In conclusion, the article highlights the need for positive school climates, adequate information on how to access AP STEM opportunities, and culturally relevant curricula to support students from underrepresented communities in pursuing their interests in STEM fields. As the authors note, "To increase enrollment of students of color in AP STEM courses, leaders must create positive school climates where students of color feel safe and have a sense of belonging."</p>
